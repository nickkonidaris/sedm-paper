\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The SED Machine has a ``rainbow camera'' that takes simultaneous four-band images; and a spectrograph which accesses the field in the 30x30 arc second box. This image was taken at $\alpha $18h47m59 and $\delta $+20:16:37. The large white circle is 9 arcminute in diameter. The plate scale is 0.394"/pixel yield a 13.5 by 13.5 arcminute field of view. From upper left working clockwise the field is g', u', r', and i'. In a 60-s exposure during full moon the u band sky background is 5.0 times larger than the read noise. }}{13}}

The array produces images of diameter $d$ with pitch $p$. An example spectrum is shown as the hatched rectangle. The minimum distance between two spectra is $\epsilon $ with length $L$.

Key emission lines are identified with their wavelength in nanometers. Some lines are blended, and their components are listed. A broad broad line in the infrared portion of the spectrum appears, the source of this line is unidentified. The difference in pixel positions between the redder pair of lines is about 14 and for the bluer pair is 20. Based on the pixel distances and wavelength, it is clear that prism is achieving the designed constant resolution of $100\pm 20$. }}{14}}
